# SummaDev_Dissertation_Content

This repository gathers all the code involved in building NeuSummaDev and BertSummaDev, two trained models that summarise international development project descriptions, made in the context of a MSc dissertation at University College London. 

You can find the data used in this work at the following drive folder, including SummaDevDocs, our introduced data-set for development papers summarisation: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eW-ZzkXhmbGHRaNgpEvo4Bih8IiEsWjZ?usp=sharing



We have also created a shareable app, SummaDev, that we invite you to test here: https://share.streamlit.io/gregroq/summadev/main/BertSummaDev.py

The code for developing the app is found in the SummaDev_app folder on this repo. 
BertSummaDev is hosted in the following Huggingface hub repo: https://huggingface.co/Greg1901/BertSummaDev_AFD

NeuSummaDev is loaded into this github repo.
